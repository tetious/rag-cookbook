"""
Agentic RAG - End-to-End Evaluation
Full pipeline evaluation measuring answer quality, groundedness, and efficiency.

This eval runs the complete agentic RAG pipeline and measures:
1. Groundedness: Is the answer supported by retrieved documents?
2. Answer Quality: Is the answer helpful and accurate?
3. Retrieval Efficiency: How many docs/steps were used?
4. Agent Behavior: Did it make good decisions (tool choice, decomposition)?
