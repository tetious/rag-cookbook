"""
Agentic RAG - Query Decomposition Evaluation
Tests quality of breaking down complex questions into sub-questions.

For complex questions, the agent should:
1. Recognize the question is complex (is_complex = true)
2. Generate appropriate sub-questions that cover all aspects
3. Each sub-question should be specific and answerable independently

This eval measures:
- Decomposition detection (did it recognize complexity?)
- Coverage (do sub-questions address all parts of the original?)
- Quality (are sub-questions well-formed?)

Original Complex Question:
{original_question}

Expected Aspects to Cover:
{expected_aspects}

Generated Sub-questions:
{sub_questions}

Evaluate the decomposition on these criteria:

1. COVERAGE: Do the sub-questions collectively address all aspects of the original question?
   - All expected aspects should be covered
   - No major parts of the original question should be missing

2. SPECIFICITY: Are the sub-questions specific enough to retrieve relevant information?
   - Each sub-question should be focused and clear
   - Vague or overly broad sub-questions are not good

3. INDEPENDENCE: Can each sub-question be answered independently?
   - Sub-questions shouldn't require answers from other sub-questions
   - Each should make sense on its own

4. RELEVANCE: Are the sub-questions relevant to the original question?
   - No tangential or off-topic sub-questions

Rate each criterion from 1-5 (1=poor, 5=excellent) and provide brief reasoning.
